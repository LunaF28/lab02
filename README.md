## Project Goals
This lab assignment is designed to deepen your understanding of GitHub's collaboration features, focusing on pull and push operations, working with branches on GitHub, and the GitHub Flow. It combines theoretical insights with practical exercises to make you understand how to collaborate effectively on projects using GitHub.

## Tools
- A computer
- Internet connection for installation and documentation reference
- A GitHub account

## Learning Outcomes
These assignment learning outcomes contribute to the following course learning outcomes described in the course syllabus:

1. Describe and explain processes such as software installation or design for a variety of technical and non-technical audiences ranging from inexperienced to expert.
2. Use professional-grade integrated development environments (IDEs), command-line tools, and version control systems to compose, edit, and deploy well-structured, web-ready documents and industry-standard documentation tools.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Writing (Theoretical Understanding)
- **GitHub Pull & Push**: Understand the concepts of pulling from and pushing to repositories on GitHub, and how these operations enable collaboration.
- **GitHub Branch**: Learn about branches in GitHub, how they can be used for feature development, bug fixes, and experimentation.
- **GitHub Flow**: Grasp the GitHub Flow, a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects in deploying regularly.

### Part 2: Practical Exercises
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine to start working on the assignment.

### Part 3: Working with Branches on GitHub
1. **Create a New Branch**: On GitHub, create a new branch for a feature or bug fix you'd like to work on.
2. **Push Changes**: Make changes locally and push them to your branch on GitHub.
3. **Open a Pull Request**: From your branch, open a pull request to the main branch.
4. **Review and Merge**: Engage in the review process with your classmates, and merge the pull request once it is approved.

## Summary
- Submit a report detailing your experience with GitHub's pull and push operations, working with branches, and following the GitHub Flow. Discuss how these practices facilitate collaboration and project management.

## Deliverables
Please submit your work by pushing it to your GitHub Classroom repository.
- You will modify the files `writing/git_command.md` and `writing/reflection.md` to respond questions in the document.

## Project Assessment
- **Report Quality (40%)**: The quality of the writing in `writing/reflection.md` will be assessed, focusing on clarity, structure, and adherence to the assignment guidelines.
- **Git Command Proficiency (60%)**: Correctly answer questions related to Git commands in `writing/git_command.md`.

## Gator Grade
### GatorGrade Checks for Immediate Feedback

To provide immediate feedback on your submissions, we're utilizing GatorGrade. Upon submission, if there's a thick red X, it indicates missing components. This X will turn into a green check mark once your submission is complete. For details on what's missing, click on the red X.

To meet the lab assignment's baseline writing and commit requirements, you can use the department's `GatorGrade` tool. Ensure Python3 is installed on your computer (check with `python --version`). If Python is not installed, please follow these guides:
