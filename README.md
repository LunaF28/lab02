## Project Goals
- Deepen understanding of GitHub's collaboration features.
- Explore pull and push operations.
- Work on branches on GitHub.
- Demonstrate the GitHub Flow.
- Enhance skills for collaborating effectively on projects using GitHub.

## Tools
- A computer
- Internet connection for installation and documentation reference
- A GitHub account

## Learning Outcomes
These assignment learning outcomes contribute to the following course learning outcomes described in the course syllabus:

1. Describe and explain processes such as software installation or design for a variety of technical and non-technical audiences ranging from inexperienced to expert.
2. Use professional-grade integrated development environments (IDEs), command-line tools, and version control systems to compose, edit, and deploy well-structured, web-ready documents and industry-standard documentation tools.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Clone the Repository and Read the README.md File 
1. Click on the assignment link and accept the assignment.
2. Use the `git clone` command followed by your repository's URL. (Find this URL on your GitHub repository page under the "Code" button.)

### Part 2: Creare a New Branch: 
1. Delete the "TODO" here.
2. Create a new branch named "update_readme".
3. Push this new branch to the GitHub repository.

### Part 3: Explore Pull and Push Operations: 
1. Delete _**"This is a typo"**_ here.
2. Open a pull request for your branch with the commecnt "Delete a typo."
3. MergeÂ your pull request.

### Part 4: Git Commands
- Please complete the TODOs in `writing/git_command.md`.

### Part 5: Write about GitHub Collaboration
- In `writing/reflection.md`:
    - Discuss how the pull and push mechanisms in GitHub are fundamental to the functionality of distributed version control systems.
    - Share your insights and personal experiences with utilizing GitHub branches
    - Explain What is GitHub Flow? Provide a thorough analysis beyond its basic definition, focusing on the importance of each GitHub Flow step and its impact on collaborative software development.

### _Notes_: 
- Make sure to put your assignments in a folder named after your course. After you upload them to GitHub, your work is saved and you can get to it anytime.
- Within `writing/git_command.md` and `writing/reflection.md`, you will find several TODOs awaiting your completion. As you work, please ensure to remove all TODO markers. 
- For this lab, GatorGrader will verify that all TODOs have been eliminated and that your submission includes a minimum of 300 words.

## Resources
- Git Documentation: https://git-scm.com/doc
    - Pro Git book: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
- Coursera: https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github

## Deliverables
Please submit your work by pushing it to your GitHub Classroom repository.
- You will modify the files `writing/git_command.md` and `writing/reflection.md` to respond questions in the document.

## Project Assessment
- **Completion of Steps 2 and 3 (20%)**: Successfully completing Steps 2 and 3 will each contribute 20% towards the assessment
- **Report Quality (40%)**: The quality of the writing in `writing/reflection.md` will be assessed, focusing on clarity, structure, and adherence to the assignment guidelines.
